      <p>Project Description</p>
      <p>For this project, we are creating a music player than can play, rewind, 
	fast forward, pause, replay and stop playing a song. Additional functions include 
	adding a progress meter that moves across the page as the music plays, showing the 
	album cover while the music plays, randomly selecting another song from a different 
	artist.</p>

        <p style="color: white">Hello! My name is Angela Kihiko. I am a computer scientist and musician from Louisville, KY. 
	In high school, I was the first chair in my symphonic band. 
	Since then, I am finding ways to combine my loves of music and technology. 
	At Spelman College, I have had several opportunities to make such connections. 
	I am creating my own soundboards, coding music sounds, 
	and now creating a virtual music player with my colleagues.</p>

        <p class="title">Creator</p>
        <p style="color: white">I believe that the greatest benefit of using music is as a therapeutic 
	idiom in any setting is that fact that music and sound helps us make connections. 
	Connections to others, connections to thoughts and feelings and, perhaps most importantly, 
	connections to ourselves. Music can help us retrieve and find the real self that is still inside, 
	even when confusion may take over.As a computer science major and a self proclaimed music connoisseur, 
	i was more than glad to create and join a team that has the same passion as me and work on this 
	project together and make everyone realize that Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, 
	wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything.” — Plato.</p>

        <h2 style="color:white">Angela Stewart</h2>
        <p class="title">Creator</p>
        <p style="color: white">I’m a just cool kid at Spelman College majoring in Computer Science. 
	I have always been a techy nerd and a music lover. I grew up singing in choirs 
	and acting in musicals by day, and playing tons of video games and browsing through 
	social media by night. There’s not a day that goes by that I am not listening to music, 
	singing a song, or not using my phone or computer. As I would play my video games, I always 
	had my music by my side. Similar to how music can help set the tone of a movie, I always used music 
	to set a tone for my life. It even sets a tone for my virtual gaming life as I play make believe 
	with my characters in the many RPG’s I’ve played. Music and technology have always been my escape 
	from reality. I am happy to be part of a team that wants to help others create their own realities 
	with our Music Player.</p>
